# Project Settings
# This file contains optional configurations for the project. These settings can also be specified via environment
# variables or within a .env file located at the project's root.
# Priority is given to environment variables over the .env file.
# Environment variables should be formatted as "<SECTION>_<SETTING>", e.g., "DATABASE_ENGINE".
# It is strongly advised to define the variables listed in the 'environ' list either as environment variables
# or in the .env file, and the `make production` command will fail if they are not specified.
