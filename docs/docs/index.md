# Welcome

After building many django projects, I found that I always need to write some common code, such as user authentication, user registration, user profile, etc. So I decided to write a template project to help me quickly build a new project.

This project aims to set up a Django project with best practices and some common functions. This is an open source project, you can use it for free, and you can also contribute to it.
